## Abstract

- Singing Voice Separation (SVS) tries to separate singing voice from a given mixed musical signal.
  - Recently, many U-Net-based models have been proposed for the SVS task,
  - but there were no existing works that evaluate and compare various types of intermediate blocks that can be used in the U-Net architecture.
- In this paper,
  - We introduce a variety of intermediate spectrogram transformation blocks.
  - We implement U-nets based on these blocks and train them on complex-valued spectrograms to consider both magnitude and phase.
  - These networks are then compared on the SDR metric. 
- When using a particular block composed of convolutional and fully-connected layers, it achieves state-of-the-art SDR on the MUSDB singing voice separation task by a large margin of 0.9 dB.

## Bacground

### Singing Voice Separation (SVS)

- a special case of Music Source Separation (MSS)
- aims at separating singing voice from a given mixed musical signal.

### Related Works

- Roughly categorized into two groups
  - waveform-to-waveform models: tries to generate the vocal waveforms directly 
  - **spectrogram-based models**: estimates spectrograms (usually magnitude) of vocal waveforms.

## Spectrogram-based models

  1. Apply Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on a mixture waveform to obtain the input spectrograms.
  2. Estimate the vocal spectrograms based on these inputs 
  3. Restore the vocal waveform with inverse STFT (iSTFT).

## Related Works: U-Net-based SVS Models

- U-Net[2]: an encoder-decoder structure with symmetric skip connections
  - These symmetric skip connections allow models to recover fine-grained details of the target object during decoding effectively.

- U-Net-like Models for SVS (or MSS) [1, 3-6]
  - They have revealed that U-Net-like architectures can provide promising performance for SVS and MSS.

## Related Works: Intermediate blocks

- Existing works proposed various types of neural networks for intermediate blocks.
  - Some models used simple **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** 
  - Other advanced models tried more **complex intermediate blocks**.

## Motivation

- No existing works that evaluate and directly compare these different types of blocks

- We conduct a comparative study of U-Nets on various intermediate blocks.

- We validate hypotheses such as that inserting time-distributed operations into intermediate blocks can significantly improve performance

2. For each type of block, we implemented at least one SVS model, which are all based on an identical U-Net framework for fair comparisons
3. we summarize the experimental results and discuss the effect of each design choice

## 3. Experiment

1. Dataset: [Musdb18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html)
    - The train and test sets of MUSDB have 100 and 50 musical tracks each, all stereo and sampled at 44100 Hz.
    - Each track file consists of the mixture and its four source audios
    - Since we are evaluating on singing voice separation, we only use the `vocals' source audio as the separation target for each mixture track

2. Model Configurations
    - Each model is based on the U-Net architecture on the CaC framework
    - We set $c_{in}^{(1)}$, the number of internal channels to be 24
    - Each model uses a single type of block for its intermediate blocks.
    - We usually used an FFT window size of 2048 and a hop size of 1024 for STFT

## 3. Experiment: Training and Evaluation

- Training
  - Optimizer - RMSprop with learning rate $lr \in [0.0005, 0.0001]$
  - Loss function - Mean Squared Error
  - Data Augmentation [20]
    - linear mixture of audio clips from different tracks
- Evaluation
  - Evaluation Tool: [official evaluation tool](https://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-e) of the SiSEC2018
  - measure SDR (Source Distortion Ratio)
    - we report the average of `median SDR values' over three runs for each model

## 4. Discussion: Developing Reusable Insights

- Our work provides a practical guideline for choosing  fundamental building blocks to develop an SVS or MSS model based on the U-Net architecture as follows.
  - TDC-based models are sensitive to the number of blocks, compared to TDF-based models.
  - Using down/up-sampling is important for CNN-based blocks, especially in the frequency dimension. 
  - Stacking 2-D CNNs is a simple but effective way to capture T and F features, compared to TDC-RNNs. 
  - Injecting a time-distributed block to a time-frequency block can improve SDR. 
  - A simple extension from a magnitude-only U-Net to a CaC U-Net can improve SDR.

## 4. Discussion: Developing Reusable Insights (2)

- Our work is not limited to the U-Net-architecture nor MSS. 
- Blocks can be used as core components in more complex architectures as well. We can use different types of blocks for a single model, meaning that a lot of space remains for improvement.
- Also, our observations can be exploited in other MIR tasks such as Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) or Music Generation
  - for example, we expect that injecting TDFs to intermediate blocks for $f_0$ estimation model can improve performance since fully-connected layer can efficiently model long-range correlations such as harmonics
